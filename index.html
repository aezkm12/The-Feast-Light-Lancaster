            <b>Ate Raki: </b>I was lost— it has been 6 years or so since I have been looking for
            answers. <br /><br /> 
            I was 13 and confused. Honestly, naaya lang ako before.
            Akala ko pa nga, hindi ko maeenjoy since I’m not a church person but
            surprisingly, I did. I felt closer to God than I ever was. Slowly, I
            embraced religion and to be honest, I was already questioning it
            before. Totoo pala; totoo na hindi mo makikita si Lord. Pero you
            know what I realized? Totoong ramdam mo Siya. Totoong makikita mo
            Siya in different forms and faces. In my case? I saw Him through The
            Feast. I believed— I do still believe. From then on, O was
            encouraged by Kuya Ge to serve and I decided to take his offer.
            Hindi madali— wala namang madali. Pero I realized na kahit mahirap,
            kahit maraming nawawala, bumabalik, at nadadagdag, andiyan pa rin si
            Lord pa sa’tin. Sabi nga nila, the more na nalalapit ka kay Lord,
            the more challenges you will face and that’s true. Noong pandemic,
            nawala ‘yung nakasanayan na’ting small and big hangouts. Hindi namin
            alam kung paano magpapatuloy at higut sa lahat, hindi namin alam
            kung ipag papatuloy pa ba. First few months, nakapag adapt sa online
            set up. Sa una, wala gaano nanonood, wala gaanong engagements,
            hanggang sa dumami at nawala ulit— nakakadrain. We decided to take a
            break at nagpa guide kay Lord sa magiging outcome. And here we are!
            Coming back stronger than ever. Kung para kay Lord, walang
            imposible. Kung para kay Lord, kahit anong mangyari, it will be
            successful. <br /><br /> 
            I am a servant from The Feast Lancaster— and I can never not be proud of that.

          <p>
            <b>Thea:</b> As I reminisce on the events of December 19th, 2023, I
            can't help but remember the call I had with Kuya Ge. I could sense
            his excitement from the moment he invited me to join the call. As
            soon as we connected, he got straight to the point. "G ka ba
            mag-serve sa Feast, Thea?" he asked, referring to the weekly prayer
            gathering of the Light of Jesus family that takes place in our
            community. <br /><br />
            I had been expecting this question, but it still caught me off
            guard. I paused for a moment to gather my thoughts before
            responding. Serving in the Feast was a big commitment, but I knew it
            was an opportunity to give back to my community and connect with
            like-minded individuals. I asked him if he could give me a month to
            decide so I could think about it and be sure of my decision.
            <br /><br />
            On January 28, 2023, I found myself attending an event that I had
            not been to in two years. I was hesitant to go, even though I knew
            what was expected of me and what to do there. It just felt awkward
            to come back after all that time. To ease my nerves, my mom invited
            my boyfriend Christian to come along with me, so I wouldn't feel out
            of place. <br /><br />
            As we arrived, I was surprised to see familiar faces from our
            school, including my friend Trish, whom I have known since the first
            grade. Seeing her made me happy, and I started to think that maybe
            attending the event wasn't so bad after all. <br /><br />
            I expected to see an older preacher, but instead, a new guy named
            Kuya Ge took the stage. He was the perfect speaker for the audience
            filled with kids and teenagers, in other words, the youth. He was
            relatable and inspirational all at once, and I was impressed by his
            ability to engage the audience. Since that day, we have continued to
            attend "big hangouts" every month. It has been a year since I first
            returned, and I can say that I am glad that I did. <br /><br />
            After Kuya Ge saw me and Christian's dedication to attending the
            Feast, he asked if we wanted to serve. This led to a call we had
            that day. A month later, Kuya Ge checked up on me and asked if I
            wanted to serve. I finally responded with a big yes! <br /><br />
            As I walked into the Feast, I couldn't help but feel excited. It was
            the 6th anniversary of the event, and it was my first time attending
            as a servant. I had been looking forward to this day for weeks, and
            now it was finally here. I was going to serve alongside my friends
            and co-servants, Trish and Kirk, as one of the singers in the Feast.
            <br /><br />
            Christian, on the other hand, was in charge of creating the website
            for the event and managing the visual aids. Together, we were going
            to use our talents to serve God and encourage others to do the same.
            Although I wasn't the best singer, I was glad that I could use my
            voice to praise God and inspire others. As the event began, I felt a
            sense of fulfillment wash over me. It was truly a wonderful feeling
            to be able to serve God in this way. Despite being new to serving, I
            felt a sense of belonging and togetherness with my friends and
            co-servants; we were like a family. <br /><br />
            Looking back on that day, I'm grateful that I said yes when I was
            asked to serve. That one decision led me to be around such wonderful
            people for a great purpose. It was an experience that I will always
            cherish in my heart
